# Digital-Timer-Widget
A digital timer widget created using Greenfoot that can be imported and used in other scenarios. The digital timer can countdown from a maximum value of 99999 to 0s within a margin of error of +/- 0.01s. Once the countdown has started, the timer can be increased up to the maximum number on its display. There are five different themes that the timer supports (see Themes.png) each with a different colour scheme and song that plays when the timer reaches 0. Download the TimerExample.webm video (on Windows) to see a basic use of the timer in a Greenfoot game.

The file can be executed by extracting the .gfar and executing it in Greenfoot. A copy of the code as well as an image of the colour scheme and the audio samples (.wav) are provided.
